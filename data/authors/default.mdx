Thanks for stopping by my website. Below I've written about myself in the hopes it gives you a glimpse of who I am, what I've done, and where I'm going.

**Fall 23' Update**: Looking for a new engineering manager role. Laid off recently.

## Overview

For over 20 years I've worked as a software engineer dedicated to high quality delivery and solving complex problems. The last 5+ years I've held multiple engineering management and leadership roles.

> Build experiences, not software

My **core mission** is building diverse, high performance teams delivering the best experiences. We are customer/experience first thinkers that apply the engineering lense. Our actions and decisions are impactful, needle forward progress pushing us towards success in the now and our future.

## Experience

As a past lead engineer I've primarily developed full stack **Javascript**, **React**, and **Node**. My current track is senior engineering management leading large teams and various disciplines.

Companies I've been worked at in the past include **[DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com)**, **[Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com)**, **[OpenLane](https://www.openlane.com)**, **[Arrive Logistics](https://arrivelogistics.com**)**, and **[ClearStory Data](https://www.clearstorydata.com)**.

More information available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dandigangi).

## Other

Coaching and mentoring is a true passion. Spots are available and I'm particularly interested in supporting underserved groups. Previously I've worked with engineers ranging from junior to senior, staff, and even other technical leaders. Product owners and designers are more than welcome also.

[ReactLoop](https://2019.reactloop.com) is Chicago's only ReactJS conference that a few friends and I organized in 2019. We're looking for new collaborators and partners to bring it back in 2024. COVID burned us in 2020 but our first year we sold out,

### The Longer Story
My background is cliche in some respects but my background started in hacking games, creating game art, and digital art.

In gaming I spent days on days hacking into Age of Empires decompiling DLLs, writing simple if/thens, and creating character art. One day my dad caught me using MS Paint dabbing pixel-by-pixel creating Achilles black Myrmidon armor based on the 2001 Troy movie w/ Brad Pitt.

He asked what I was doing and in turn introduced me to Photoshop which is my longest running skill set. What a lifesaver for my time and catalyst for what would become my future.

Getting older I started to move into digital art using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Cinema4D. My career as an artist didn't go nearly as far as my friends who became top tier artists but it was a great experience. If you've known me long enough you'll remember me from the IF Skin Zone and my forum Elite Graphics.

Those skills took me into freelance where I created websites, designed marketing/print, and went deep into Wordpress/LAMP stack. Arrogantly I even took my portfolio at 16 to apply for a design job at State Farm. They shot me down but it didn't matter.

It didn't stop me from continuing forward growing as both an engineer and designer.

What's important is the foundation was built and supported my future career every step of the way. I've been permanently influenced with an exceptionally passionate drive towards the best design and user experiences.

It took many years for my tagline "build experiences, not software" to come to life but it's been my core mission for longer than I can remember.
