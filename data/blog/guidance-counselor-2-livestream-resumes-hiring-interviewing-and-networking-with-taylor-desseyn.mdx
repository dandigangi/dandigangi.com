Taylor Desseyn (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/tdesseyn">@tdesseyn</a>) invited me back to Guidance Counselor 2.0 to do an episode on salary negotiations and onboarding. The 30 minutes flew by quickly but it was a great conversation and grateful to be part of it. We touched on tips and tricks for how to handle negotiations and understanding your value in the market. In the onboarding discussion there is guidance for both engineers and companies on how to approach and improve those processes.

Please give it a watch and make sure to follow Taylor!
