*Recorded 4/1/24*

The Tech Commute is a Twitter/X Space where we all learn together, celebrate achievements, and talk to some of the most incredible people in tech on the planet. Not sure I'd classify myself nearly that cool, Jason, but thanks for having me on. It was a fun chat on engineering, the job market, and mental health.

I couldn't figure out why this felt so long ago. Searched up and down X and we did this back on 4/1/24 right before I started back at [ActiveCampaign](https://activecampaign.com). It's been a long, long year but finally got this up!

Also, Jason has been working to the bone since I've met him to build himself and a career in tech. He joined [torc](https://www.torc.dev) recently as a community evangelist. They're lucky to have you and I'm proud of what you've been accomplishing. Keep it up, brotha.

Make sure to check out the full podcast on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4kW4BzuDBdTrX5TRxEufmC) and [follow Jason on X](https://x.com/TasonJorres). Jason's hosts some really amazing people and the conversations are interesting to say the least.
