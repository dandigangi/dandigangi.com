Since my blog is actually becoming a thing I'm catching up on the past with some posts. [React Loop](https://2019.reactloop.com) (RL) is Chicago's first ReactJS conference in 2019 organized by two friends and myself. COVID burned us having the next couple years unfortunately. I'm trying to bring it back in 2024 if you're interested. Contact me at [dandigangi.proton.me](mailto:dandigangi.proton.me).

There is a variety of topics covered and not just about React. Check them out below. All the videos are available on the [React Loop YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@reactloop6901/videos).

Note - This is when [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react) came out so some content may be out of date.

- [Michael Jackson - Composing Behavior in React or Why React Hooks are Awesome](#mj) (Opening Keynote)
