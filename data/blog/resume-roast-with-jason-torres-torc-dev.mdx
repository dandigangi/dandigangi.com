Stumbled onto X and found [Jason Torres](https://x.com/tasonjorres) from [Torc.dev](https://www.torc.dev) was roasting resumes. I had to join in. Thanks to Luke and Noah for sitting in the hot seat. We hope you and others found it helpful.

I show up around 17m. Mostly there to annoy Jason tbh. ðŸ˜‚
