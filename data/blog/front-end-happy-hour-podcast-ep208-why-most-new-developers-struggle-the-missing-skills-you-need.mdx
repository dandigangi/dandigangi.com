I'm back everyone. The past few months settling into my new engineering leadership role running <a target="_blank" title="Visit Postmark.com" href="https://postmark.com">Postmark</a> (under <a href="https://activecampaign.com" target="_blank" title="Go to ActiveCampaign.com">ActiveCampaign</a>) put a pause on content so I'm very excited to start showing face again.

Ryan Burgess graciously invited me back to Frontend Happy Hour. Leaning into my passion for mentoring we focused this episode on the skills new developers to the industry need. It's a rough time for tech right now. Especially if you're new. We hope you find this helpful!

Thanks for watching/listening.
