<Video title="Arrested DevOps: The Dev Show EP3 Guest Panelist" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25235P0tOJo?si=yZbZlsf5pLRoAiUY" />

This was a long time ago and one of my first videos w/ my friend Matt Stratton on his podcast Arrested DevOps. Matt and I worked together at Apartments.com. I've worked in front end engineering for a long time but have an affinity for DevOps/infrastructure thanks to Matt. This was before DevOps was a buzz word in the tech industry. He is a terrific person and passionate about his work. Hoping we'll have the opportunity to work together again in the future.

Matt organizes the Chicago <a target="_blank" href="https://devopsdays.org">DevOps Days conference</a>. It's definitely an event worth checking out in 2024 and meeting the Yak. (<a target="_blank" href="https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/welcome/">Chicago 2023</a>)
