The past 6 months I've had the pleasure of teaching at [Upright Education](https://uprighted.com) as a software engineering instructor. It's been a great experience repositioning my interest and passion for mentoring into teaching.

I'm proud of what the learners accomplished to say the least. This recording comes from their final presentations and graduation day. Each group used a variety of technologies revolving around the MERN stack.

I posted previously about [joining Upright here](/blog/joining-upright-education-part-time-software-engineering-instructor).
