Decided to build a list of resources for current and aspiring engineering managers. Learn the trade or improve your current skill set. There's a wealth of knowledge out there and I'm happy to lift up others content.

This is the first version so it will be less organized and detailed. You can find this on this website's repo but I dedicated a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dandigangi/engineering-manager-resources">separate one you can find here</a>. (<small>**LAST UPDATED**: 1/30/24</small>)

This was inspired by my friend <a href="https://github.com/ryanburgess/engineer-manager">Ryan Burgess's list</a>. I'm sure there will be crossover but I swear it wasn't stolen. üòù Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/burgessdryan" target="_blank">follow him on Twitter</a>. Super grateful for all his support.

**WARNING**: 48 Laws of Power has some great content in it but also things that felt malicious and manipulative. While there is always a side in a sense that leadership is non-malicious manipulation (aka understanding psychology) it really didn't align to my personal values at points.
