Here we go. My first shot at video content.

I was laid off recently from my engineering management position. It has had a profound impact on my life and mental health. Since video content has been on my mind over written lately I decided (with a healthy dose of push from [Taylor](https://twitter.com/tdesseyn) & [Jason](https://twitter.com/tasonjorres)) to hit on something that's been upfront in my life.

The cuts are a bit rough but the only way to get out of my comfort zone was to just do it and publish.
