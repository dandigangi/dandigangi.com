Jason and I couldn't resist another round of resume reviews. This episode we got into more detail on content and good design. For those of you working towards the senior level, check out around 18 minutes. We discussed non-technical responsibilities that are important to bring out in your resume.

If you're interested in having your resume reviewed hit me up on X at [@dandigangi](https://x.com/dandigangi). Shoutout to Israa and Nishant for letting us roast!
