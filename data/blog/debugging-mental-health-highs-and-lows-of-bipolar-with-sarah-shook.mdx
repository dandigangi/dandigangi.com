It's 3am. I can't sleep for the life of me and happen to stumble across a tweet from someone I don't follow named [Sarah Shook](https://twitter.com/shookcodes). She asked if anyone was interested in being part of a Twtter Spaces podcast of sorts focused on mental health in the software industry.

Absolutely. I'm in.

A few DMs later we planned an episode together. Sarah and I discussed in this episode my software career and the various battles I've had with mental health. I'm clinically diagnosed with bipolar 2, generalized anxiety, and ADHD. My bipolar has trended towards depression the past few years but early on it was significantly more manic.

Those that know me may be reading this and thinking how they may have ever could have missed it.

**Why? I don't externalize on others. No matter how I feel I refuse to lay my emotional stresses on others.**

In fact, one of my mentors said I was making a career mistake a being open about it. It was the first time I've reconsidered being public. My gut told me that I'd be doing a disservice to myself and others with similar battles.

**Why? Mental health carries stigma in tech and is severely undervalued relative to physical health.**

We can't begin to break this together and create open safe, trusting environments for vulnerability without others taking the first steps. I sincerely admire for Sarah for starting this Space. It takes real courage to open conversations around mental health. It's a few people and small steps towards change. But it only takes a few small steps and people to bring change and impact.

You know what they say - awareness is half the battle.

If even one person is positively effected listening in I think Sarah would agree we hit our goals.

Thanks for inviting me on Sarah. Appreciate you.
